# noclip

The most important thing to know about `noclip` is that this software is named after a common cheat code. It was originally called `unclip`, but I realized after the fact that `noclip` is a cooler name and a little bit easier to type.

Noclip has two usage modes:

- Copy
- Paste

`noclip c` activates copy mode, which stores in the clipboard whatever you pipe to stdin. `noclip v` activates paste mode, which prints to stdout whatever is on the clipboard.

God knows what this does with anything other than text. Have fun!
